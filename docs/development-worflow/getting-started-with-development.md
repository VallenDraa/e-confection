# Getting Started With Development

There are two necessary steps before starting development. The backend and the frontend of the project needs to be started, Here is How.

## Starting The Backend Development Server

To start the backend dev server you can:

1. CD into the backend folder. Make sure to have installed all of the backend dependencies.
2. type `npm run dev`. Make sure you have made the `.env` file. The instructions are written in [installing dependencies](./installing-dependencies.md) module on the **Backend Dependencies** section.

## Starting The Frontend Development Server

To start the frontend dev server you can:

1. CD into the frontend folder. Make sure to have installed all of the frontend dependencies.
2. type `npm run dev`.

All code changes made during development will instantly be reflected, whether on the backend or the frontend.
